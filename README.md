What is BioBoards:

	-BioBoards is a platform that allows users to create a custom “board” and share it through a link in their social media bio. This board would serve as an extension to their social media. Boards can contain pictures, links, and text and allow users to create a custom page for users who view their social media profile to view. BioBoards merges what similar platforms like Linktree and VSCO are meant for (allows a user to redirect people who visit one of their social media profiles to their other platforms like Linktree and allows a user to share more about their personality and life through images like VSCO).

Features:

	-Features an secure authentication process that allows users to sign in/sign up to their accounts. 

	-Usres can create, edit, and store up to three custom boards on their profile.

	-A extensive text-editor where users can create their boards imported from the TinyMCE API
 
 	-Users can share their boards with a custom URL using react-router-dom which creates a link containing arguments of the user id and board number, and sends other users to a view-only page of that specific board.

Why:

	-At the start of college, I met hundreds of people and ended up asking questions like "What is your major" and "Where are you from" too many times too count. While it was great to meet a diverse group of people from across the world, I couldn't remember all of the basic information I learned about each and every person I met. I thought a platform like BioBoards this would create a more convenient way to share basic information about yourself and even redirect new people you meet to your other social media accounts.
Outcomes:

	-This was the first project I have built where I did not need to follow a tutorial for any aspect of the project. It allowed me to solidify my understanding of full-stack development with the MERN.js stack. While I still have a lot to learn, I was able to increase my confidence signifcantly with using the MERN.js stack and create a product I'm proud of on my own.
